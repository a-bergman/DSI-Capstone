# Problem Statement

Left ventricular dilation, also known as dilated caridomyopathy, simply put is the enlargement of the left ventricle determined by the volume of blood in the left ventricle during the heart's diastolic phase.  The condition is serious because the muscle wall in the left ventricle thins and its ability to pump blood out of the heart is seriously impact: the condition contributes to serious caridac conditions such as clots, arrythmias, valvular disease, or congestive heart failure.  It is important for a physician to determine if a subject is at risk for or has ventricular dilation. 

The diagnosis is usually determined through MRI volume measurements, not every physician has access to them.  Machine classification can help relieve the pressure on individual physicians by making predictions directly from MRI measurements and subject biometrics.  This project thusly has two facts:

- 1. How accurately can classification predict subjects who are at-risk or who have left ventricular dilation.

- 2. Looking at different metrics, is classification an effective method for predicting dilation?
